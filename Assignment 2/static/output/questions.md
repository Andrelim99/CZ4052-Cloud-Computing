 **Question 1:**
**question**: What is cloud computing?
**possible_answers**:
a) A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
b) A type of software that allows users to access their files from any device.
c) A way to store data online.
d) A type of computer that is connected to the internet.
**correct_answer**: a) A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
**explanation**: Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. This means that users can access computing resources, such as storage, processing power, and software, over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Question 2:**
**question**: Which of the following is not a key cloud concept?
**possible_answers**:
a) On-demand self-service
b) Broad network access
c) Resource pooling
d) Rapid elasticity
**correct_answer**: c) Resource pooling
**explanation**: Resource pooling is not a key cloud concept. The key cloud concepts are on-demand self-service, broad network access, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

**Question 3:**
**question**: Which of the following is not a deployment scenario for cloud computing?
**possible_answers**:
a) Private cloud
b) Public cloud
c) Hybrid cloud
d) Multicloud
**correct_answer**: b) Public cloud
**explanation**: Public cloud is not a deployment scenario for cloud computing. The deployment scenarios for cloud computing are private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multicloud.

**Question 4:**
**question**: Which of the following is not a cloud computing service model?
**possible_answers**:
a) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
b) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
c) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
d) Network-as-a-Service (NaaS)
**correct_answer**: d) Network-as-a-Service (NaaS)
**explanation**: Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) is not a cloud computing service model. The cloud computing service models are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

**Question 5:**
**question**: Which of the following is not an advantage of cloud computing?
**possible_answers**:
a) Lower computer costs
b) Unlimited storage capacity
c) Increased data reliability
d) Reduced software costs
**correct_answer**: d) Reduced software costs
**explanation**: Reduced software costs is not an advantage of cloud computing. The advantages of cloud computing are lower computer costs, unlimited storage capacity, increased data reliability, improved performance, and easier group collaboration.
